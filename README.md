# RESEARCH (project at ALx Africa Software Engineering Program)
* **WASTE COLLECTION WEB APPLICATION**
``A waste collection app for efficient and effective waste collection and management in Ghana (rural & urban areas)``

# WASTE COLLECTION WEB APPLICATION :computer:
```
This research and project proposal is based on a gap that has been identified in the waste collection and management ecosystem in Ghana.
In the jurisdiction, there are less than 20 formal waste collection firms. In retrospect, demand in the ecosystem is higher than the supply of services.
The problem identification is delays in the collection of household waste which leads to soil, air water and aesthetic pollution.
The project proposal is meant to develop a software application system that enables households to notify waste collection firms on timelines that will be appropriate to collect waste at the exact location.
The app would feature a GPS that will indicate locations of specific locations that request for the services of waste management firms, almost like what we have with uber and bolt application requests in Ghana.
Additionally, there would be suggestions on waste segregation. In Ghana, waste segregation is one of the major problems in the circular economy. 
Being able to collect different types of waste would help in the recycling process and help in reusing certain items again.

## Technologies and Languages required for the web application:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend
- Python – Backend

## App Users:
- Households in Ghana

## Problems the app will solve:
- Delays in waste collection
- Waste segregation

## Possible Limitations:
- The app will most likely be limited to households in urban areas
- There are chances that some locations might be difficult to navigate because of discrepancies in the GPS in Ghana. (Some locations are not properly mapped)

## Possible Solutions:
- Train households in rural areas on the use of the map
- Improve integration of locations in the GPS in Ghana


## Existing Solutions:
- Coliba Waste Collection Application (Ghana)

## Similarities and Differences:
- The similarity between this proposed application and that of Coliba is the ability for households to request waste collection services.
- The difference is that Coliba is was only made to support Android however the suggested web application will exist on both IOS and Android


## API and Methods:
``http://ghana.wasteapp.com/v1``
* **Others would include api remote, controllers etc.**

## Project Management:
Currently all user stories are being handled by team using the current trello board for the project. It can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/invite/userworkspace59049493/ATTIe74db98fb9c585a66c7381bfd3dc1e578B499C73)
